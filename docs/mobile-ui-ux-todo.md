# Mobile UI/UX TODO

1) Audit (homepage, worker, company, admin) for overflow, dense layouts, and touch targets.
2) Global UI tokens: typography, spacing, buttons/inputs states, safe-area padding.
3) Mobile navigation: AppShell nav consolidation (scrollable pill nav) + clear action grouping.
4) Responsive layout pass: cards, lists, and data-heavy views to stacked blocks/collapsible detail.
5) Form UX: full-width fields, spacing, inline help/errors, loading/disabled clarity.
6) QA: long labels, large numbers, landscape, reduced motion.

Notes
- Prioritize AppShell + UI components because they impact every screen.
- Keep files <= 300 lines; split if needed.
